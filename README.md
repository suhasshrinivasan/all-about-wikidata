This repository consists of a bunch of methods to query and manipulate data from the Wikidata knowledge base (and also Wikipedia). These methods provide a high-level interface programmed in Python that simplifies access to Wikidata.

Contents:
1. qids.py - contains class for retrieving, storing and managing QIDs (unique Wikidata identifiers) using sparql queries.
